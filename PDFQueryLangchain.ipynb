      " Abstract  \n",
      "This paper  focuses on how artificial  intelligence  (AI) and big data can be used in cardiovascular diseases  \n",
      "(CVD)  applications such as electrocardiography, echocardiography and angiography  by reviewing existing \n",
      "literature. Key studies have been presented in this paper for these  fields and how AI has helped the \n",
      "researchers in accomplishing their objective  by enhancing the diagnostic and predictive accuracy  of these \n",
      "tools. However, limitations exist still in this research such as data privacy concerns . Which is why future \n",
      "work to leverage the benefits of AI is necessary where clinicians are able to trust this technology for the \n",
      "betterment of human health especially in CVD research. This is because coupling AI with CVD presents a \n",
      "promising future for efficient methods for cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment.  \n",
      "1. Introduction  \n",
      "AI and Big Data are very beneficial in healthcare by providing many opportunities to improve disease \n",
      "diagnosis, prediction as well as treatment. With regard to cardiovascular diseases (CVD), it is crucial  for \n",
      "accurate diagnosis on time. Therefore, the fusion of AI and CVD will help save many lives and make the \n",
      "entire diagnosis to treatment process more seamless.  \n",
      "2. Artificial Intelligence and Big Data  \n",
      "AI is the “branch of computer science that mimics the human mind process”  which was invented by Alan \n",
      "Turing in 1950s (Krittanawong, et al., 2017). Even though  there is no clear definition of what AI is, the use \n",
      "of AI will help in making our lives better and help in so many fields including healthcare  (Kagiyama et al., \n",
      "2019) . In the health sector, the use of AI can be used for many applications which includes, “medical \n",
      "diagnosis, treatment, risk prediction, clinical care and drug discovery” (Gulshan, et al.,  2016).  \n",
      "Machine learning (ML) is another term that is used alongside AI. ML algorithms identifies  trend s in the \n",
      "given dataset and build s a model capable of performing classification tasks on the training dataset \n",
      "(Rajkomar, et al., 2019) . Subcategories of machine learning include  “supervised learning, unsupervised \n",
      "learning and reinforcement learning” ( Yan, et al., 2019).  \n",
      "Reinforcement learning (RL) is where the programmer sets a goal, and the algorithm accomplishes this goal \n",
      "based on either supervised or unsupervised learning which is the first part of RL (Yan, et al., 2019). The \n",
      "second part includes a “feedback mechanism”  which is also known as a “reward” for the AI (Johnson, et \n",
      "al., 2018). Therefore, the aim of reinforcement learning algorithm is to have the highest reward in its \n",
      "training cycle (Yan, et al., 2019).  \n",
      "Deep learning (DL) is another topic that is discussed along with AI. DL falls under ML which is described \n",
      "as a “computational method that enables the algorithm to automatically program and learns from big data” \n",
      "(Gulshan, et al., 2016). It is a powerful too l that is capable of training neural network models to behave like \n",
      "a human mind. In addition to that, DL can understand  complicated dependencies between the data set \n",
      "compared to ML (Esteva, et al., 2019).  \n",
      "Figure 1  illustrates  the relationship between big data and AI and its application in the health care sector. It \n",
      "indicates that big data such as  imaging & EHR , are applied  to AI algorithm s like ML and DL , for several \n",
      "applications in CVD like disease diagnosis, prediction of risk and imaging interpretation. The figure \n",
      "outlines the dependency  between  big data and AI , and one must utilize  both to make a fully functional \n",
      "automated diagnostic or predictive algorithm.  Page 4 of 11 \n",

      "With techniques going back to the 1960s, the electrocardiogram (ECG) has shown to be a quite useful \n",

      "of these will be discussed further.    \n",
      "Attia et al. have done a study where they utilized a dataset of 12 -lead ECG, echocardiogram and the left \n",

      "4. Limitations  \n",
      "Despite the numerous advantages of using AI based technology for classification of CVD, certain \n",
      "limitations remain . Primary limitation among them is the challenge of establishing trust in the technology, \n",
      "as people often struggle to understand  the decision -making processes of AI algorithms , which prompts  \n",
      "researchers to exhaust their efforts on transparency (Kwon, et al., 2020). Furthermore, another limitation is \n",
      "regarding assurance that this algorithm would perform on large scale, unseen, data reliably (Vaid, et al., \n",
      "2022).  As the  model's training is based on historical data , there is a risk of poor performance on new, \n",
      "untrained data . This concept is also referred to as overfitting of the data (Haq, et al., 2021).  \n",
      "Additionally, there are also security and privacy concerns related to this field. This is due to  the current \n",
      "guidelines not  regulating research bodies on their use of private health information , how they store it and \n",
      "develop models based on them  (Haq, et al., 2021). Another limitation with A I is the phenomenon of the \n",
      "‘black box’ (London, 2019) which means the clinicians do not understand how the model was able to make \n",
      "the output based on the input it was provided. It is important to mention another limitation of incorporating \n",
      "AI to CVD is that training these algorithms requires  a lot of computational power and necessitates the use \n",
      "of high -end machinery which add s to the cost (Xu, et al., 2020).  Page 8 of 11 \n",
      " 5. Future Work  \n",
      "According to Haq, et al. we learnt that a lot of literature focuses on research done on data produced by \n",
      "means of computer  modelling therefore, the implication  of future work is to incorporate “ multi -center  \n",
      "randomized control trials ” with AI technology. This is important because it overcomes one of the limitations \n",
      "of ML that it does not generalize well on new data and produces  improper results . It can be done by multi -\n",
      "centers correctly label ling data and mak ing it available for many organizations whilst also considering the \n",
      "different diversities in the world. Data overfitting can be avoided while  making the algorithm generalize \n",
      "well on unseen data (Haq et al., 2021).   \n",
      "Additionally, another limitation was the lack of published studies on this field. Therefore, the future \n",
      "prospective should be to increase  funding for AI related research  (Haq, et al., 2022).  \n",
      "Moreover, work should be done to improve the  understanding  of AI  by clinician s to increase use of AI \n",
      "based applications or service s. To address this issue,  it is suggested  to have courses that teach students about \n",
      "these topics at university level ( Karatzia, et al., 2022) .  \n",
      "6. Conclusion  \n",
      "CVD are the leading cause of death in the world which calls for robust systems to be deployed in the \n",
      "health settings for the disease diagnosis and prevention. Therefore, it is beneficial to use AI and big data \n",
      "in CVD applications such as electrocardiography, echocardiography, and angiography. This is proven by \n",
      "the numerous st udies in this field who seem to show a positive impact on the patient's health. Despite the \n",
      "advantages, there are limitations also such as privacy concerns, overfitting, and lack of AI -related \n",
      "information amongst clinicians. Therefore, future work should f ocus on multi -center randomized control \n",
      "trials along with an increased funding for AI -based research and educational initiatives to gain the most of \n",
